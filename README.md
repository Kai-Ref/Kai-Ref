I am a highly motivated Data Science student at University Mannheim with practical experiences in developing modelling pipelines and real-time forecasts. During my internship at ICIS, I worked on developing an OTC Backtesting statistic for the company website and created and maintained multiple classification algorithms for European power markets. Following this, I then successfully developed and analyzed a DeepAR pipeline in an Infectious Disease Forecasting environment as a Student Research Assistant at the Karlsruher Institute of Technology. Some of my projects were about:

- ðŸ¦ : Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting utilizing Amazon's DeepAR model in an Infectious Disease Forecasting environment (Repository: [DeepAR_InfluenzaForecast](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/DeepAR_InfluenzaForecast))
- âš¡: Binary Classification pipeline with the sklearn framework for an EU Power market price equality forecast 
- âš½: Webscraping Transfermarkt.com for football player and team data (Repository: [Transfermarkt Webscraping](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/footy))
- ðŸ“ˆ: Analysis of the Feature Selection properties of LASSO and Ridge regression during a Bachelor's seminar (Repository: [Feature Selection in Regression Tasks](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Feature-Selection-in-Regression-Tasks))
