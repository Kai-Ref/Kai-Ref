üéì **About Me**

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Mannheim, with a strong focus on **time series forecasting**, **machine learning**, and **applied data science**. My journey includes building real-time forecasting pipelines, developing interpretable ML models, and working on impactful data-driven projects in both academic and industry settings.

I‚Äôm driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and making data useful ‚Äî whether it's through forecasting infectious diseases or analyzing football statistics.

üìÇ **Selected Academic Projects**

Here‚Äôs a selection of my academic data science projects (B-Bachelor and M-Master):

- **üß™ M-Master‚Äôs Thesis (30 ECTS): _Proabilistic LTSF_  ‚Äì [[Github](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Probabilistic_LTSF)] [[üìÑ Thesis PDF](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Probabilistic_LTSF/blob/master/notes/Master_thesis.pdf)]**  
  Explored cutting-edge challenges in Time Series Forecasting (TSF), focusing on two key dimensions:
  1. **IMS vs. DMS trade-off in probabilistic TSF**: Demonstrated that Direct Multi-Step (DMS) models often produce unreliable sample paths due to their failure to model temporal dependencies between future predictions.
  2. **Bridging probabilistic TSF with point long-term TSF**: Combined two active TSF research streams (probabilistic TSF and point LTSF), revealing strong performance from quantile-based methods and highlighting a promising, underexplored research direction.

- **üïµÔ∏è M-Team Project (12 ECTS): _Explainable Deep Fake Detection_ ‚Äì [[GitHub](https://github.com/nilsbecker0711/Interpretable-Deep-Fake-Detection)]**  
  Over a 6-month period, our team of six master's students investigated the potential of B-Cos networks for deepfake detection. Our key contributions include:  
  1. Introducing B-Cos networks into the domain of deepfake detection by integrating them into the open-source [DeepFake Benchmark](https://github.com/SCLBD/DeepfakeBench), thereby enabling further research in this area. Moreover, we also developed the first B-Cos-enhanced version of XceptionNet by applying the B-Cos transformation.  
  2. Proposing the novel Mask Pointing Game, a new method for evaluating explanation quality that advances research on inherently interpretable models within facial forensics. Our qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrated that ante-hoc B-Cos models outperform state-of-the-art post-hoc explainable AI techniques.

- **‚úàÔ∏è M-Data Mining Project (6 ECTS): _Flight Price Prediction_ ‚Äì [[GitHub](https://github.com/arschrei/dm-project-23)]**  
  Modeled flight prices using XGBoost, RandomForest, and SVMs.

- **‚öΩ M-Web Data Integration Project (3 ECTS): _Football Data Integration_ ‚Äì [[GitHub](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Web-Data-Integration)] [[üìÑ Report PDF](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Web-Data-Integration/blob/main/Web_Data_Integration_Project.pdf)]**  
  Integrated data from multiple football sources using web scraping and schema matching in Java.

- **ü¶† B-Bachelor's Thesis (12 ECTS): _DeepAR for Infectious Disease Forecasting_ ‚Äì [[GitHub](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/DeepAR_InfluenzaForecast)] [[üìÑ Thesis PDF](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/DeepAR_InfluenzaForecast/blob/main/Thesis_Kai_Reffert.pdf)] [[üìë LNI Paper](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/DeepAR_InfluenzaForecast/blob/main/LNI_DeepAR_KReffert.pdf)]**  
  Introduced the application of DeepAR for probabilistic influenza forecasting by addressing the underexplored gap of global deep learning models in epidemiology, showing that DeepAR significantly outperforms traditional and neural baselines in accuracy and uncertainty quantification ‚Äî offering a scalable, data-efficient solution for public health forecasting.

- **üìä B-Bachelor Seminar (4 ECTS): _Regression Feature Selection_ ‚Äì [[GitHub](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Feature-Selection-in-Regression-Tasks)] [[üìÑ Seminar Report PDF](https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Feature-Selection-in-Regression-Tasks/blob/main/Seminararbeit-Variable%20selection%20in%20regression%20tasks.pdf)]**  
  Compared LASSO and Ridge for feature selection in regression tasks.

- **Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Student Research Assistant)**: Built a DeepAR-based probabilistic forecasting pipeline for infectious disease spread.
